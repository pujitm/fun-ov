# (Fun)ctional Object Validation for Typescript and Javascipt

The goal of this library is to provide a flexible and intuitive way to perform runtime validation
of objects and values in Javascript.

This package was created because validation is a recurring need, and existing solutions at the time of development
did not meet the author's standards for style, modularity, customizability, and extensibility.

## TODO

### Tests

For defaults provided: (object, list, type-checkers)

- different type than expected
- null/undefined values
- empty
- single
- normal
- valid
- invalid
- nested
